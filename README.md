I’m an aspiring **Data Engineer** currently halfway through the *Data Engineering Bootcamp* at NOVI University of Applied Sciences.  
After completing the *Programming Fundamentals* module (15 EC), I’m now diving into **Data Science (30 EC)** — focusing on data integration, analysis, and visualization.

I enjoy turning complex data into clear insights and reliable solutions.  
My long-term goal is to design and maintain **data pipelines** and **analytics systems** that help organizations make smarter, data-driven decisions.
