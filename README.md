I’m an aspiring **Data Engineer** with a Python-first toolkit.  
Currently halfway through my **Data Engineering Bootcamp** at NOVI University of Applied Sciences,  
where I’m learning to combine **programming fundamentals, data handling, and engineering skills**.  

I enjoy building **interactive CLI apps**, integrating **APIs**, and turning ideas into structured, working code.  
My goal: to grow into a professional **Data Engineer** who creates reliable, scalable, and useful data solutions.
