🎯 *Bootcamp student halfway to becoming a Data Engineer — building with Python, APIs, and data analysis.*  

I’m a student **Data Engineering** at NOVI University of Applied Sciences (expected graduation: **Feb 2026**).  
Currently halfway through my program, I enjoy turning ideas into working projects with **Python, APIs, and data**.  
My ambition is to grow into a professional **Data Engineer** who builds data pipelines and analytics solutions  
that make processes smarter and more reliable.
